# pico 8 stuff

In this repository, I collect informations and sources of a few experiments for the fantasy console Pico-8.


## about the console 

Pico-8 is a fantasy console designed for creating and playing small, retro-style games. It has limitations on graphics, sound, and code size, encouraging a minimalist approach to game development. Pico-8 provides a self-contained environment with a built-in code editor, sprite editor, and sound editor, making it accessible for hobbyists and game developers to create and share games with a nostalgic aesthetic.
